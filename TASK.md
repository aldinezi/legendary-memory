# Mockups
Desktop: https://marvelapp.com/prototype/7i98ae7/screen/63368126/handoff 

# Description
The project consists of developing a responsive single-page web application (SPA) that has functionality for displaying, creating and editing to-do list items.

Application look and feel should be as faithful as possible to the mockups provided.

# Requirements
It must consist of two visually separate lists: To-do and Done.
Once an item in To-do is checked, it's moved to the Done list.
An item must be able to be dragged & dropped between two lists.
Each item in the To-do list must contain an editable label and a checkbox. 
Done list items cannot be editable but they can be moved back to To-do list where they become editable again. 
Both items from To-do and Done can be deleted. 
Done items have an option to delete all of them.

Login screen is not required, but it can bring bonus points. 
All assets can be found inside the mockups.

Note: Since this is an SPA, no user action should trigger full window reload.

Additional technical requirements:
Application must be developed using Vue.js and Vue CLI.
Project must use version control and it can be published to a private GitHub repository.

Once the project is finished and ready for evaluation you can share the GitHub repository with us.

The project should be documented (in English) using a README file with this content:
- Short description of general technical implementation
- Instructions on how to run it locally
